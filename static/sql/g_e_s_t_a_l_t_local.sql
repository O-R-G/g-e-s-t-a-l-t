Theoretically I might say there were 327 brightnesses and nuances of color. Do I have 327? No, I have sky, house, and trees. It’s impossible to achieve 327 as such. And yet even though such droll calculation were possible and implied—say for the House, 120, the trees, 90, the sky, 117—I should at least have this arrangement and division of the total not say 127 and 100 or 150 and 177. The concrete division which I see is not determined by some arbitrary mode of organization lying solely within my own pleasure. Instead I see the arrangement and division which is given there before me [↙].&nbsp;</blockquote><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00010.png\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>And what a remarkable process it is when some other mode of apprehension does succeed. I gaze for a long time from my window, adopt after some effort the most unreal attitude possible, and I discover that part of the window sash and part of a bare branch together compose an “N.” Or look at a picture.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00011.png\"><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote>Two faces cheek-to-cheek [↑]. I see one with its, if you will, 57 brightnesses and the other 49 brightnesses. I did not see an arrangement of 66 plus 40 nor 6 plus 100. There have been theories which would require I see 106. In reality I see two faces. Or I hear a melody, 17 tones with its accompaniment, 32 tones. I hear the melody and accompaniment not simply 49 and certainly not 20 plus 20 plus 9. And the same is true even in cases where there is no stimulus continuum. I hear the melody.&nbsp;</blockquote><div><img src=\"/media/00012.png\"></div><div><br><blockquote>Or one sees a series of discontinuous dots [↑] upon a homogenous ground, not as the sum of dots, but as figures. Even though there may have been a greater latitude of possible arrangements the dots usually combine in some spontaneous, natural articulation and any other arrangement even if it can be achieved is artificial and difficult to maintain. When we are presented with a number of stimuli we do not as a rule experience a number of individual things—this one and that. Instead larger holes separated from and related to one another are given an experience. Their arrangement and division are concrete and definite.</blockquote></div><div><br></div><div>This is an excerpt from what’s known as the “Dot Essay” from 1923, written by Czech psychologist Max Wertheimer, and more accurately known as ”Investigations in Gestalt Principles,” or “Laws of Organization in Perceptual Forms.” It’s a strange text that shifts between letters and dots. The dots assemble and reassemble into constellations that read more like sentences—initiating, picking up, or expanding on an idea. Although the text is didactic and intended to be instructive, it has a restive quality. Since it is performing the subject matter that it’s also attempting to explain, it’s hard to make it stay still. And through its shifting nature, the text articulates the fundamental Gestalt qualities,  which describe how distinct groupings of the same dots can be seen&nbsp;</div><div>to be related to one another.</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"/\">Continues in class . . .</a><br></div>',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(3,1,'2021-08-11 11:27:39','2021-08-11 12:14:52',NULL,'September 14',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'september-14',NULL,'2021-09-14 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								A Few Forms',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><img src=\"/media/00013.png\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Here’s Max Bill [↑].

This image gives me some—perhaps false—insight into Bill’s character, as someone who would be able to draw such a precise circle again and again on the chalkboard in overlapping configurations. Bill was born in 1908, in Switzerland, and studied architecture. He identified as an architect and, in fact, designed many buildings, but he was also a graphic designer. He was also an industrial designer. He was also an artist and a teacher and a writer. Bill was a generalist who didn’t make crisp distinctions between design practices—he let the projects and the work lead.

He studied psychology at the University of Berlin under Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Köhler. At the time Max Planck and Albert Einstein were also teaching at the school, so it was a rich moment. Psychology was part of the Department of Philosophy, and the Psychological Institute at the University of Berlin was housed on two expansive floors of the Imperial Palace. The ad hoc situation provided plenty of room for the students to setup and conduct experiments on each other. Much of the interest around the Institute was in Gestalt psychology and perception, and Arnheim was drawn to all of this.&nbsp;</div><div>He was also interested in art and personal expression, and when he left school he began to bring the lessons of Gestalt psychology directly into the fields of art and design at schools like Sarah Lawrence College, Harvard University, and the University of Michigan, where he taught psychology and wrote about art.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Arnheim published several books which translated Gestalt psychology for the world of art and design, two of which are well-known. The first, Art and Visual Perception (1954), has been translated into 14 languages and remains one of the most consequential art books of the 20th century. The second was a bit less of a publishing juggernaut—Visual Thinking (1969) [↘].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00016.png\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>As the title suggests, it wrestles with the differences between perceiving and thinking, suggesting that they are the same thing.

Arnheim lays out a series of visual thinking exercises in the text by which picturing a model in your mind’s eye helps to reveal parts of a problem that would not be so easily described otherwise. In one, Arnheim asks the reader to imagine a 3 × 3 × 3 cube composed of 27 individual cubes. (Basically, it’s a Rubik’s cube.) The cube is painted red on all sides. Now, picture the cube, turn it around, have a look and a think.

Dondis, published by MIT Press in 1973, and is currently in its 23rd printing. It was designed by Muriel Cooper. Cooper and Dondis were classmates at Massachusetts College of Art in the 1950s and remained friends.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When the book was written, Dondis was teaching graphic design at Boston University in the School of Public Communication and Cooper was design director at MIT Press. (She would soon start teaching in the Department of Architecture.) The book evolved from a running conversation between the two around teaching graphic design in the context of massive changes to the media landscape. The book proposed that in an age of mass electronic visual communication (such as television), reading and writing images was as fundamental as reading and writing words. Dondis ends the first chapter describing what’s at stake:</div><div><br></div><blockquote>What you see is a major part of what you know, and visual literacy can help us to see what we see and to know what we know.</blockquote><div><br></div><div>The book presents itself as a kind of extended slide lecture, or a series&nbsp;</div><div>of lectures marked off as chapters; running texts interjected with demonstration images, in-line illustrations that work like projected illustrations. The book’s pacing is deliberate and the tone is solidly didactic and incremental. Reading it feels like sitting in a classroom, in a good way.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The proximity of author and designer and their shared investment in the contents led to a subtly strange layout. The book’s typography is slightly off and feels automated, with a uniformly light Univers type, consistently awkward letterspacing, and affectations such as underlines in place of italics. Turns out that the typography was a consequence of its production. At the time Muriel Cooper had set up a research unit in the basement of the MIT Press offices and was exploring the application of electric and electronic typewriters to produce camera-ready typography. This book was set on an (only) slightly more advanced system, the IBM Electronic Composer which allowed for variable-spaced typesetting in a wider range of types. The great advantage was that layouts could be created completely in-house and this resulted in a more iterative design and editing process. The disadvantage was the quality of the typesetting. This is also part of what gives the book a visual spark [↓].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00019.png\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>When I’ve used this book in teaching (which is often), I ask students: Why does the cover look like it does?

We are going to watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-VjtvgCGrWg\">some choice excerpts</a> from a 30-minute excerpt posted online.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Corita Kent worked most substantially in prints, typically roughly assembled silkscreens.

This picture captures something of that spirit:</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00006.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Her and her students’ prints were vehicles for a particular flavor of spiritual messages which mixed a benevolent Catholic mysticism with reaching out to the secular world in all of its complexities. She described this medium in particular in how and what she hoped to accomplish:</div><div><br></div><blockquote>[printimaking] enables me to produce a quantity of original art for those who cannot afford to purchase high-priced art. … The distribution of these prints to everyday places of work pleases me, and I hope they will give people a lift.</blockquote><div><br></div><div>Corita Kent\'s work has been widely shown since. In the last few years there are at least two exhibitions which I would like you to have a look at. <a href=\"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/exhibitions/4830/corita-kent-and-the-language-of-pop\">“Corita Kent and the Language of Pop”</a>&nbsp;was initiated at the Harvard Art Museum in 2016 and tracks parallel streams in Kent\'s work and contemporary art of the time.<a href=\"https://tang.skidmore.edu/exhibitions/56-someday-is-now-br-the-art-of-corita-kent\"> “Someday is Now: The Art of Corita Kent”</a> originated by the Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College looks like it was especially strong.

These include electrical schematics, road signs, and hobo symbols [↓].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00020.png\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Hobo symbols are used to mark places, for example, along a freight train route, to indicate what may or may not be available in a town or area or what kind of people and reception to expect somewhere—helpful tips for the next traveler. The top left one is a sleepy town. The two diamonds next to each other indicate “go slow.” One that actually looks like what it means is the armed man. The triangle actually looks terrified. The bent arrow for a storm is an interesting choice. Look at the symbol for hostil­ity; that would be a hard assignment. These are icons that might be written along a well-worn hobo route, on train cars, or on a fence. They were meant to be read only by this self-selected group (tramps, hobos, vagabonds) that has decided to live this way and to adopt this visual language.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Symbols could be combined. For example, here [↙] we see armed man plus fierce dog. And then this one [↘], which looks like a face and it combines symbols from three sets to convey its message: “I am in a narrow place between rain and snow, please help.”</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00021.png\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>This work is typical Munari—it is funny, it’s curious, it’s synthetic, and it’s visual. He’d have called it “design research.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"/\">Continues in class . . .</a><br></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(9,1,'2021-08-11 11:32:48','2021-08-11 12:30:55',NULL,'November 2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'november-2',NULL,'2021-11-02 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								RGB v CMYK',_binary '<div>Assignment 3, RGB v.

Therefore, proceed empirically, comparing printed colors to screen colors. For example, what happens when you print the brightest on-screen green and compare the printed sheet to the glowing screen?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Using these practical experiments as a guide, refine the inquiry to one part of this broad problem. For example, investigate how printed ink fades over time and discover if there is a corollary effect on screen. Or focus only on the color green which is tricky to render in both models. Or investigate sub-pixels on-screen and halftone dot patterns on the printed page. From there explore the limits of what either system can handle. All of these experiments are just that, hands-on experiments. This is a design research project where thinking and making are collapsed into one fluid activity.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Weeks 3–4: The final products of this assignment are variable and completely open.&nbsp;</blockquote><div><br></div><div>Where the previous assignments were prescribed and directed, the working method for this project should more accurately reflect the lateral thinking and meandering processes that are the stock and trade of a lively design practice.

But he also almost didn’t do any of those things.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00007.jpg\"><br></div><div><div><br></div><div>Applying to Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1942, Corrin was brushed off with a curt note from the dean saying,&nbsp;</div><blockquote>Negro students have not found the work of our department satisfactory to their needs ...</blockquote><div>and suggested that he apply instead to Fisk University, a historically African American school in Nashville, Tennessee. Corrin replied with a cascade of recommendation letters and the school reversed its decision, admitting him as its first African American student. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from what would become Carnegie Mellon University and went on to study set design at Yale University School of Drama, receiving an MFA in 1951. After a brief tour of military duty in the South Pacific, Corrin landed a design job at ABC Television in New York. He was fascinated by the technical and social possibilities of television and how design could participate. He soon had the chance to manifest his interest.</div><div><br></div><div>In 1960, the presidential debates were to be televised, for the first time, with ABC, CBS, and NBC collaborating on four broadcasts. ABC hosted the third debate, but due to a scheduling conflict, it would be staged remotely with Senator John F. Kennedy in an ABC studio in New York and Vice President Richard M. Nixon on a set in Los Angeles. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8SdDhojNT2o\">This was a live broadcast</a> where—using the electronic medium of television and cross-country data links—<a href=\"https://youtu.be/8SdDhojNT2o?t=50\">the two candidates would appear to be in the same room</a>. The set design was central to pulling off this illusion. Corrin was tasked with creating two identical sets which would also look convincing as a split-screen image.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>Corrin continued to work with ABC for 13 years on sets, on-screen graphics, and various&nbsp;design projects. In 1962, the network invited an American graphic designer with an already large reputation to create a new logo<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span></div><div><img src=\"/media/00009.jpg\"><br></div><div>The designer was <a href=\"https://www.paulrand.design\">Paul Rand</a> and here is a portrait from at least a few years before.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00008.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand\">Peretz Rosenbaum</a> was born in Brooklyn in 1914. Painting signs for his father’s grocery store led to studying design at Pratt Institute at night while attending public high school during the day for a more “practical” education. At Pratt, Rosenbaum assembled a portfolio of clean, modern design work and decided to modernize his name as well. Being Jewish, like being African American, at the time made working in design difficult. For all of its social rhetoric and its mostly liberal practitioners, the profession has a dreadful track record on diversity. Cloaking his Jewish identity, Rosenbaum took on the concise advertising-ready moniker made up from two sets of four letters: “Paul Rand.”</div></div><div><br></div><div><a

'\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>High on his rooftop in North Beach, San Francisco, 1966, after ingesting a mild dose of LSD, Stewart Brand imagined the subtle curvature of the earth as he gazed out at the surrounding high-rises, noticing that they were not really parallel, the high-rises, and that the further you might view them from, the more extreme the curve, until finally, viewed from space, the Earth would resolve to a perfectly spherical marble, not dissimilar from the finite planet that Buckminster Fuller had been insisting we must all understand if we were ever to get civilization on this planet right, something Stewart Brand had been considering since his initial undergraduate coursework in biology at Stanford followed by his studies in design and photography at San Francisco Art Institute in 1962, which led him to spending three years on various Native American reservations in the American West culminating in a multimedia event in 1964 while simultaneously engaged by a growing interest in the space program at a time when the left was deeply suspicious of the defense industry initiative, so he tuned in, turned on, and dropped out, organizing The Trips Festival at The Longshoremen’s Hall in San Francisco in 1966 before joining Ken Kesey’s Band of Merry Pranksters traveling on a bus they named “Further” across the country which he professed to find mind opening and indirectly led to a profound conceptual leap, imagining a picture of the Earth from space and understanding its political aesthetic implications which inspired him to begin immediately the next morning making buttons that read,&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><blockquote>Why haven’t we seen a photograph of the whole earth yet?</blockquote><div><br></div><div><div>and distributing these paranoiacally stated provocations widely, sending unsolicited packages to scientists, secretaries of state, astronauts, and thinkers like Marshall McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller (whose humbling response to “Why we haven’t seen a photograph of the whole Earth?” was, “Well, you can only see about half the Earth at any given
